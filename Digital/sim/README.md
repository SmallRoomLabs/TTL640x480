# Implementation of the circuit in "Digital"

This is a implementation of the TTL640x480 circuit in Helmut Neemanns "Digital" simulator from https://github.com/hneemann/Digital.

To run the test (`VGA_TTL640x480.dig`) the Digital version v0.23-75 or newer must be used since this file uses the VGA-screen component to actually show the output from my circuit.

The `TTL640x480.dig` should be able to be run from any version of Digital.
